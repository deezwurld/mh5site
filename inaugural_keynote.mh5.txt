<p class="has-pale-pink-color has-text-color">As the year begins in rolling fashion, so are my duties as a sole owner of a small electronics company! I won't lie, it's hard as hell to be a small business owner. There's just so many hats to wear and bunch of shit to keep up with it's a lot, but you know what I realized???</p> <!--@@NOTE:Pay Microsoft sub today@##@#-->

<p class="has-pale-pink-color has-text-color">Every headache and hassle of running my own business easily translates into common duties and responsibilities of everyday life and most jobs. Think about it! Most jobs have basic components: Finance, Sales, Admin, and HR. I won't delve into an explanation of how these work-related job titles and responsibilities correlate to our everyday lives, but they do. </p>

<p class="has-pale-pink-color has-text-color">What's cool is that in honor of this inaugural keynote, I'm living a nanoscopic portion of my work dream which is to simply blog remotely! Dat's right (#inMyJTmoneyVoice), ya girl is blogging on the beach, looking at a Pacific sunset, drinking a very nice beverage and checking emails. </p>

<p class="has-pale-pink-color has-text-color">I'm like 40/60 with my love-hate regards for on-site work, especially being in iT. And it really has little to do with actual work. Mainly its workplace environment for me with most of what I've encountered since the Pandemic.  Whether it's poor workstation ergonomics or horrendous company breakrooms, those are just minor examples of how I see the workforce moving further away from solid retention paradigms. </p>

<p class="has-pale-pink-color has-text-color">Either way, I'm focused on what mH5 got going on and that's really maintaining a stable single-owned company and nurturing it over time. I don't have a business plan and feel I don't need one per se. From what I've seen, there are people in this country that don't even speak English well or even count U.S. currency all that good and are wealthy. I know what I'm talkin' about. </p>
